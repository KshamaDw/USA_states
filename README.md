# USA_states
Adjacency matrix and graph for the 49 physically connected states in the USA.

I was trying to find an adjacency matrix for the states in USA but wasn't able to find one that was perfectly suited for me.
So, wrote up this code to do the same! The adjacency graph (symmetric for neighboring states and hence, undirected) and adjacency matrix can be downloaded from adj_graph.mat or adj_matrix.mat repsectively.
